            <p>As a senior at The University of Colorado Boulder, I am currently studying Electrical Engineering and Technology, Arts, and Media. I'm constantly striving to improve my techniques, expand my skillset and find new opportunities to grow. Each of my projects - both solo and collaborative - have provided me with valuable experience that allowed me to establish myself within this competitive industry. Please enjoy my portfolio, and feel free to get in touch with any questions.</p>
            <p>My personal goal in ATLS2200 Web is to create my own digital portfolio that showcases the work I have completed in my undergraduate experience.</p>
