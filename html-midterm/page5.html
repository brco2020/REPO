    <h1>HTML-Midterm</h1>
    <h2><strong>Brooke Cochran</strong></h2>
    <h3>Page 1: <em>Errors</em></h3>
    <ol>
        <li>There is a missing html opening and closing tag, as well as the doctype at the beginning. I fixed this error by placing the html opening and closing tags around the exsisting code and the !DOCTYPE tag as the first line of code.</li>
        <li>The next error I found is the incomplete em closing tag in line 79 that results in the rest of the text being italicized. To fix this, I add /em to complete the phrase that is supposed to be italicized and make the rest of the text regular.</li>
        <li>The links in the navigation bar that are not labeled with the correct path. By removing /html-midterm/ from the href link, I was able to fix this error for all five pages.</li>
        <li>The fourth error I found is the improper placement of h3 before h2. By swapping them, this error is fixed since h1 must come before h2, and h2 before h3.</li>
        <li>Lastly, the fifth error I found is the missing doctype at the beginning. I fixed this error by placing the !DOCTYPE tag as the first line of code.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Page 2: <em>Errors</em></h3>
    <ol>
        <li>The links in the navigation bar that are not labeled with the correct path. By removing /html-midterm/ from the href link, I was able to fix this error for all five pages.</li>
        <li>The link to Segmental Arch did not have a valid URL, so I linked it to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_arch which is the Wikipedia webpage that describes it. There is also an improperly linked element "bay" in line, so I fixed this link to go to it's Wikipedia page as well (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bay).</li>
        <li>The New Beehive in is surrounded in a b tag that is not closed. By adding a backslash before the b in the closing tag, the stagement is contained so that all of the text is not bolded.</li>
        <li>H6 should not come before h3, and since h3 is used below it, I changed the code for the "History" title to be h3 as well. Likewise, h2 cannot be a child element of the b tag in line 53, so I moved the tag to within the opening/closing h2 tag to solve this error.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Page 3: <em>Errors</em></h3>
    <ol>
        <li>The table contains a missing closing tag in line 83 after "Lily". Line 83 should be moved to line 5 so that there are 3 td tags per tr tags. By moving this line, the number of columns is changed to 3 as it is intended to be. Similarly, Line 94 needs to be moved to line 92 to maintain 3 columns. Lastly, lines 99 and 100 must be swapped to ensure that the td tag is inside of the tr tag. This error is fixed by inserting td inside the empty closing tag.</li>
        <li>The second error I found on this page is that line 54 is missing an "i" in the opening and closing li tag, which is solved by inserting the "i" to complete the li tag in both places on this line.</li>
        <li>The last error I found is in line 81, which has a th tag instead of a td tag. By switching this in both the opening and closing tag of line 81, the table is correctly completed.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Page 4: <em>Errors</em></h3>
    <ol>
        <li>The first error I found is that line 52 is missing an opening td tag. Similarly, line 42 is missing a closing td tag. By inserting these tags in front or behind the image element, I was able to fix this error.</li>
        <li>Line 47 is missing both an opening and closing td tag. By inserting these tags around the image element, I was able to fix this error.</li>
        <li>The third error I found is that the document is missing the !DOCTYPE html tag. By inserting this tag as the first line, this error is solved.</li>
        <li>Lastly, all of the images are missing the "alt" attribute. I added a short description using the alt attribute to each image to solve this error.</li>
    </ol>
