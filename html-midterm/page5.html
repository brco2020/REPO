    <h1>html-midterm</h1>
    <h2><em>Brooke Cochran</em></h2>
    <h3>Page 1</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>The first error is the missing html opening and closing tag, as well as the doctype at the beginning. I fixed this error by placing the html opening and closing tags around the exsisting code and the !DOCTYPE tag as the first line of code.</li>
        <li>The second error I found is the incomplete em closing tag in line 79 that results in the rest of the text being italicized. To fix this, I add /em to complete the phrase that is supposed to be italicized and make the rest of the text regular.</li>
        <li>The third error I found is the links in the navigation bar that are not labeled with the correct path. By removing /html-midterm/ from the href link, I was able to fix this error for all five pages.</li>
        <li>The fourth error I found is the improper placement of h3 before h2. By swapping them, this error is fixed since h1 must come before h2, and h2 before h3.</li>
        <li>Lastly, the fifth error I found is the improper all-caps used in h2. the use of the strong tag is more appopriate and I capitalized the whole title for aethetics.</li>
