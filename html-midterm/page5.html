    <h2><strong>Brooke Cochran</strong></h2>
    <h3>Page 1: <em>Errors</em></h3>
    <ol>
        <li>There is a missing html opening and closing tag, as well as the doctype at the beginning. I fixed this error by placing the html opening and closing tags around the exsisting code and the !DOCTYPE tag as the first line of code.</li>
        <li>The next error I found is the incomplete em closing tag in line 79 that results in the rest of the text being italicized. To fix this, I add /em to complete the phrase that is supposed to be italicized and make the rest of the text regular.</li>
        <li>The links in the navigation bar that are not labeled with the correct path. By removing /html-midterm/ from the href link, I was able to fix this error for all five pages.</li>
        <li>The fourth error I found is the improper placement of h3 before h2. By swapping them, this error is fixed since h1 must come before h2, and h2 before h3.</li>
        <li>Lastly, the fifth error I found is the missing doctype at the beginning. I fixed this error by placing the !DOCTYPE tag as the first line of code.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Page 2: <em>Errors</em></h3>
    <ol>
        <li>The links in the navigation bar that are not labeled with the correct path. By removing /html-midterm/ from the href link, I was able to fix this error for all five pages.</li>
        <li>The link to Segmental Arch did not have a valid URL, so I linked it to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_arch which is the Wikipedia webpage that describes it. There is also an improperly linked element "bay" in line, so I fixed this link to go to it's Wikipedia page as well (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bay).</li>
        <li>The New Beehive in is surrounded in a b tag that is not closed. By adding a backslash before the b in the closing tag, the stagement is contained so that all of the text is not bolded.</li>
        <li>H6 should not come before h3, and since h3 is used below it, I changed the code for the "History" title to be h3 as well.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Page 3: <em>Errors</em></h3>
    <ol>
        <li>The table</li>
